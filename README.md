# nanophotonic_neural_inference
This  repository  contains the MATLAB and python codes for our paper (Khoram, Erfan, et al. "Nanophotonic media for artificial neural inference."). The MATLAB code uses many parts of the MaxwellFDFD package (W. Shin, MaxwellFDFD Webpage, 2015. https://github.com/wsshin/maxwellfdfd) for the electromagnetic field simulations; while the python code uses a modified version of the FDFD solver in the Angler package available at "https://github.com/fancompute/angler" created for Hughes, et al.'s work, ("Adjoint method and inverse design for nonlinear nanophotonic devices." ACS Photonics 5.12 (2018): 4781-4787.) for the electromagnetic simulations. These codes are not neccessarily the final versions used for the published paper and therefore they may have small errors, or be different from what is presented in the paper; nevertheless, they provide the general code structure used in the paper and can be used to understand the implementation of our concept.
